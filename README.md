# Standard-error-calculation
Calculate the standard error in python, which is defined as the standard deviation of its sampling distribution by Wikipedia.

Create a Python computer program to compute the mean and standard error given a population: 
Assume that the population consists of all whole numbers (integers) from and including 0 to and including 10000. 
Obviously the mean is 5000, but letâ€™s assume that we sample our population for n samples, where n = [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 5000].
